Hi All, 

This is a website I made using Flask, it has an API set up to query movie titles and the movies that actors/actresses are in. The site uses authentication, as does the API.
So, you have to go to the site, create an account and get the api key to use in REST API requests. I imported a large csv from kaggle.com into the site's database that has many popular movie 
titles. I also created a docker file for this app, so it can be deployed via docker.
